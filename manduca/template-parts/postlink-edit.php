/**
 * Displays an accessibility-friendly link to edit a post or page.
 *
 * This also gives us a little context about what exactly we're editing
 * (post or page?) so that users understand a bit more where they are in terms
 * of the template hierarchy and their content. Helpful when/if the single-page
* layout with multiple posts/pages shown gets confusing.
