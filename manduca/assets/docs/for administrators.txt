                           HOW TO ...
********************************************************************************************


...Add multiple line as site-title:
      - use '|' sign to linebreak in the general settings


... add accessible tabs
      @see: https://github.com/batyuvitez/manduca/wiki/Create-accessible-tab-page


... use Collapsable Paragraph (accessible multi-level hide-show system) page template
      - use <h2></h2> elements for titles of collapsable paragraph.
      - Before first (h2) is not collapsable.


... implement multi-level hide-show system on posts and other contents.
            You can use in #wrapper (that is #primary and #secondary)
            Enque the script. Example: page-templates/accordion.php
            Use the following classes:
            
            *obligatory
            js-expandmore  : this is the button (e.g. h2) which is the title of the collapsable part.
            js-to_expand      : this is the hide/show part (div)
            Elements that have expandmore and to_expand classes must be adjacent:
            For example: 
                  <h2 class=js-expandmore>Title</h2>
                  <div class=js-to_expand>content</div>
            
            *optional
            not-to-collapse   : use this div to add content outside the hide-show system
            js-expandmore-all : this is a button to hide all and show all. 
            is-opened         : part is visible when page has been loaded
            Use keys: space or enter to hide/show,
            Use escape to hide actual part.
            
            Detailed description see: https://a11y.nicolas-hoffmann.net/hide-show/
      
... Add homepage navmenu item: Add http://home-placement to the menu item.
      This string will be replaced with the home URL.

      
... Add accessible tooltip:
      add the following attributes to element:
            class="js-simple-tooltip"
            data-simpletooltip-text="tooltip text itself"
      @more: https://a11y.nicolas-hoffmann.net/simple-tooltip/
      
      
... Create accessible layout tables
      use the following css classes:
            responsive-table: draw border around table
                  responsive breakpoints breaking-point-30, breaking-point-40 breaking-point-100.
                  30 means 30em (Manduca has a 14px basis);
                  e.g. class="responsive-tables breaking-point-40" mean resolution < 560px has no table layout.
            table-row : for rows
            table-col and col5, col10 etc. to define the width of the col.
                  eg. class="table-col col10" means a table with 10 percent of width.

            For example
            <div class="responsive-table breaking-point-30">
                  <div class="table-row">
                        <div class="table-col col40">1. column</div>
                        <div class="table-col col60">2. column</div>
                  </div>
            </div>


... In nav menu don't want that parent menu item has individual page,
    instead, parent menu element is only a label of submenu items?
       Parent menu url shoud be only one character: #

       
... In nav menu parent  menu item links a page lists subpages?
       Use parent page template. You can add content before listing child page.


... Do not want substitute of missing featured images or want a different one:
        - Us the thumbnail substitustion section in Customizer.
