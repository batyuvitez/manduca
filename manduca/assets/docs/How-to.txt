How to ...


... use collapsable paragraph template
      - use <h2></h2> elements for titles of collapsable paragraph.
      - Before first (h2) is not collapsable.

... add new svg icons.
      Use filter 'manduca_svg_icons' Input parameter is Manduca svg icons, and you can extend it with yours.
      
... change breadcrumb parameters
      - copy breadcrumb-template file to the child theme's template-parts/header directory and change the parameters in it.
      - or - if you are familiar with PHP programming: extend the breadcrumb class.
      
... add namespace in child theme in order to avoid nam confusions::
      add the namsepace as a key to Manduca_Classloader. e.g 'Web25\\childtheme' => get_stylesheet_directory() .'/inc/'

... implement multi-level hide-show system.
            You can use in #wrapper (that is #primary and #secondary)
            Use the following classes:
            js-expandmore-all : this is a button to hide all and show all. 
            js-to_expand      : this is the hide/show part (div)
            js-to_expandmore  : this is the header (e.g. h2) which is the title of the collapsable part.
            is-opened         : part is visible when page has been loaded
            Use keys: space or enter to hide/show,
            Use escape to hide actual part.
            

...Use Adobe accessible megamenu (default until 20.7) instead of WAI menubar (since 20.7):
      change the menu_type to 1  in template-parts/header/menu.php
